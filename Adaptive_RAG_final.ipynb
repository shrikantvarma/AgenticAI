        "**A Practical Comparison with ChromaDB and OpenAI**\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook explores **Adaptive/Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, demonstrating how it can intelligently combine the strengths of **Traditional RAG** and **Agentic RAG** approaches. By routing queries based on their complexity, Adaptive RAG aims to optimize the balance between **latency** (speed) and **quality** (accuracy and depth of analysis) for different types of user questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use an **Admin trigger troubleshooting use case** to illustrate these concepts, leveraging:\n",
        "- **ChromaDB**: A vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of troubleshooting knowledge.\n",
        "- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini**: A powerful language model for generating responses and executing diagnostic steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "The scenario is as follows:\n",
        "1. There is a trigger in the system that failed.\n",
        "2. There is a document that explains how to troubleshoot triggers.\n",
        "3. The trigger setting and logs are available to the LLM.\n",

        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "## Understanding the RAG Approaches\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Traditional RAG**:\n",
        "  - **Process**: Simple, single-step approach. Retrieves relevant documents from a vector database and uses an LLM to generate an answer based *only* on the retrieved context.\n",
        "  - **Characteristics**: Generally **fast** and **low cost** due to minimal LLM interaction. Provides **generic answers** without analyzing specific system states.\n",
        "- **Agentic RAG**:\n",
        "  - **Process**: A multi-step reasoning process that involves multiple LLM calls. It retrieves relevant information from the troubleshooting guides, creates a plan dynamically *and* analyzes provided state data (like trigger settings and logs) to form a diagnosis. The LLM acts as an \"agent\" to plan and execute checks.\n",
        "  - **Characteristics**: **Thorough** and provides **specific solution**. However, it is **slower** and **more costly** due to the increased number of steps and LLM interactions.\n",
        "- **Adaptive RAG**:\n",
        "  - **Process**: Introduces an intelligent router that assesses the **complexity** of the incoming user query. Simple queries are directed to the faster Traditional RAG path, while complex queries requiring deeper analysis are sent to the more thorough Agentic RAG path.\n",
        "  - **Characteristics**: Aims to achieve the **best balance** between speed and quality by using the most appropriate method for each query type.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "## Demonstration and Comparison\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook demonstrates these approaches by:\n",
        "1. Setting up a knowledge base in ChromaDB and simulating trigger state data.\n",
        "2. Implementing and running both Traditional and Agentic RAG methods on a troubleshooting query.\n",
        "3. Comparing their performance metrics (Latency, LLM Calls) and output quality, **including evaluation of output quality using an LLM as a judge.**\n",
        "4. Implementing a simple Hybrid RAG router and testing how it routes different types of queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "- No single RAG method is ideal for all situations; there's an inherent **latency vs quality tradeoff**.\n",
        "- Traditional RAG is effective for quick information retrieval (simple queries).\n",
        "- Agentic RAG is powerful for complex problem-solving requiring state analysis.\n",
        "- **Hybrid RAG** provides a practical solution to this tradeoff by dynamically choosing the optimal approach per query.\n",
        "- Effective **query complexity assessment** is fundamental to a successful Hybrid RAG implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* * *\n",
        "\n",
        "## Summary of Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the demonstration and evaluation, the following key findings highlight the tradeoffs and benefits of each RAG approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Traditional RAG**:\n",
        "    *   **Performance**: Significantly faster and uses fewer LLM calls (and thus lower estimated cost).\n",
        "    *   **Quality**: Provides general answers based on the retrieved troubleshooting guide. It is effective for simple, directional queries (e.g., \"Where can I find triggers?\"). However, for complex troubleshooting queries, it lacks the ability to analyze the specific system state, resulting in a lower LLM evaluation score when compared to Agentic RAG using criteria that value specific diagnosis.\n",
        "    *   **Best Use Case**: Simple queries requiring information retrieval from the knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Agentic RAG**:\n",
        "    *   **Performance**: Slower and uses multiple LLM calls (higher estimated cost) due to the multi-step reasoning and state analysis process.\n",
        "    *   **Quality**: Provides a more specific, in-depth diagnosis by analyzing the provided trigger state (settings and logs) in addition to the troubleshooting guide. This leads to a higher LLM evaluation score for complex troubleshooting queries, as it offers concrete explanations for *why* a trigger isn't firing for specific tickets and suggests actionable next steps based on the state.\n",
        "    *   **Best Use Case**: Complex queries requiring detailed analysis of system state and specific problem diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Adaptive (Hybrid) RAG**:\n",
        "    *   **Approach**: Uses an intelligent router to assess query complexity and route to either Traditional or Agentic RAG.\n",
        "    *   **Performance & Quality**: Aims to strike a balance. For simple queries, it leverages the speed of Traditional RAG. For complex queries, it utilizes the depth of Agentic RAG. The average performance metrics (latency, LLM calls) fall between the two methods, depending on the mix of simple and complex queries handled.\n",
        "    *   **Value**: Provides a practical solution to the latency vs. quality tradeoff by applying the most appropriate method for each query type, optimizing resource usage and user experience across different query complexities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the evaluation using the LLM judge reinforces that while Traditional RAG is efficient for simple information retrieval, Agentic RAG is superior for complex troubleshooting tasks that require state analysis and specific diagnosis, justifying its higher cost and latency for those scenarios. Adaptive RAG offers a flexible way to gain the benefits of both approaches."

            "\n",
            "2. **Evidence from the Actual State:**\n",
            "   - The logs show that out of three processed tickets, only **TKT_124** met the criteria for the trigger to fire. This ticket had a status of \"new\" and a priority of \"high,\" which aligns with the conditions set for the trigger. The trigger successfully assigned TKT_124 to Team A as expected.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Why Certain Tickets Didn't Fire:**\n",
            "   - **TKT_123** did not fire because it did not meet the priority condition; its priority was not \"high.\"\n",
            "   - **TKT_125** did not fire due to a mismatch in the status condition; its status was not \"new.\"\n",
            "   - Since the logic type is \"ALL,\" both conditions (status and priority) must be satisfied simultaneously for the trigger to activate. Therefore, any ticket that fails to meet either condition will not trigger the action.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Concrete Next Steps:**\n",
            "   - **Review Ticket Conditions:** Examine the statuses and priorities of TKT_123 and TKT_125. If these tickets should also trigger actions, consider adjusting their statuses or priorities to meet the conditions required by the trigger.\n",
            "   - **Adjust Trigger Conditions (if necessary):** If you want to include tickets with different statuses or priorities, you may need to modify the trigger conditions or create additional triggers that cater to those specific cases.\n",
            "   - **Monitor Future Tickets:** Continue to monitor the logs for future tickets to ensure that the trigger is firing as expected and to identify any other tickets that may not meet the criteria.\n",

            "\n",
            "2. **Evidence from Actual State**: The logs confirm that TKT_124 met the defined conditions (status: \"new\" and priority: \"high\"), which resulted in the trigger firing and the ticket being assigned to Team A. In contrast, TKT_123 and TKT_125 did not meet the necessary conditions, as indicated by the log analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Explanation of Non-Firing Tickets**:\n",
            "   - **TKT_123**: This ticket did not fire because it did not meet the priority condition. The priority for TKT_123 was not \"high,\" which is a requirement for the trigger to activate.\n",
            "   - **TKT_125**: This ticket failed to fire due to its status not being \"new.\" The status condition is mandatory for the trigger to apply, and since TKT_125 did not meet this criterion, the trigger did not activate.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Next Steps**:\n",
            "   - **Review Ticket Conditions**: Examine the conditions for TKT_123 and TKT_125 to determine if they can be adjusted to meet the trigger criteria. If these tickets are intended to be processed by the same trigger, consider updating their statuses or priorities accordingly.\n",
            "   - **Adjust Trigger Logic (if necessary)**: If there are scenarios where tickets should fire under different conditions, consider modifying the trigger logic to accommodate those cases. For example, you could implement an \"ANY\" logic type for scenarios where only one of the conditions needs to be met.\n",
            "   - **Monitor Future Tickets**: Continue monitoring the logs for future ticket processing to ensure that the trigger behaves as expected and to identify any additional tickets that may not meet the criteria.\n",
            "\n",
            "By following these steps, you can ensure that the trigger operates effectively and that all relevant tickets are processed as intended.\n",

        "## Summary of Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the demonstration and evaluation, the following key findings highlight the tradeoffs and benefits of each RAG approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Traditional RAG**:\n",
        "    *   **Performance**: Significantly faster and uses fewer LLM calls (and thus lower estimated cost).\n",
        "    *   **Quality**: Provides general answers based on the retrieved troubleshooting guide. It is effective for simple, directional queries (e.g., \"Where can I find triggers?\"). However, for complex troubleshooting queries, it lacks the ability to analyze the specific system state, resulting in a lower LLM evaluation score when compared to Agentic RAG using criteria that value specific diagnosis.\n",
        "    *   **Best Use Case**: Simple queries requiring information retrieval from the knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Agentic RAG**:\n",
        "    *   **Performance**: Slower and uses multiple LLM calls (higher estimated cost) due to the multi-step reasoning and state analysis process.\n",
        "    *   **Quality**: Provides a more specific, in-depth diagnosis by analyzing the provided trigger state (settings and logs) in addition to the troubleshooting guide. This leads to a higher LLM evaluation score for complex troubleshooting queries, as it offers concrete explanations for *why* a trigger isn't firing for specific tickets and suggests actionable next steps based on the state.\n",
        "    *   **Best Use Case**: Complex queries requiring detailed analysis of system state and specific problem diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Adaptive (Hybrid) RAG**:\n",
        "    *   **Approach**: Uses an intelligent router to assess query complexity and route to either Traditional or Agentic RAG.\n",
        "    *   **Performance & Quality**: Aims to strike a balance. For simple queries, it leverages the speed of Traditional RAG. For complex queries, it utilizes the depth of Agentic RAG. The average performance metrics (latency, LLM calls) fall between the two methods, depending on the mix of simple and complex queries handled.\n",
        "    *   **Value**: Provides a practical solution to the latency vs. quality tradeoff by applying the most appropriate method for each query type, optimizing resource usage and user experience across different query complexities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the evaluation using the LLM judge reinforces that while Traditional RAG is efficient for simple information retrieval, Agentic RAG is superior for complex troubleshooting tasks that require state analysis and specific diagnosis, justifying its higher cost and latency for those scenarios. Adaptive RAG offers a flexible way to gain the benefits of both approaches."
