        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Traditional RAG:**\n",
        "*   **Quality:** Provides general, directional answers based on retrieved documents. Effective for simple queries but lacks depth and specific diagnosis for complex troubleshooting. Achieved lower scores from the LLM judge on complex queries compared to Agentic RAG.\n",
        "*   **Latency:** Significantly faster due to a single retrieval and single LLM call.\n",
        "*   **Token Usage (Cost):** Uses the fewest tokens per query, resulting in lower estimated cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Agentic RAG:**\n",
        "*   **Quality:** Provides specific, in-depth diagnoses and actionable steps by analyzing system state (settings and logs) alongside retrieved documents. Achieved higher scores from the LLM judge on complex troubleshooting queries.\n",
        "*   **Latency:** Slower due to multiple LLM calls and sequential reasoning steps.\n",
        "*   **Token Usage (Cost):** Uses significantly more tokens per query due to multiple LLM interactions, resulting in higher estimated cost.\n",

        "**Adaptive (Hybrid) RAG:**\n",
        "*   **Quality:** Selects the appropriate RAG method based on query complexity, aiming to deliver the best quality for each type (specific diagnosis for complex, general info for simple).\n",
        "*   **Latency:** Balances speed by using the faster Traditional RAG for simple queries and accepting the higher latency of Agentic RAG only when necessary for complex queries. Overall latency depends on the mix of query types.\n",

For real-world applications, understanding the nature of user queries is crucial for setting the complexity threshold and fine-tuning the router."

By routing queries based on their complexity, Adaptive RAG aims to optimize the balance between **latency** (speed) and **quality** (accuracy and depth of analysis) for different types of user questions.\n",

        "## Understanding the RAG Approaches\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Traditional RAG**:\n",
        "  - **Process**: Simple, single-step approach. Retrieves relevant documents from a vector database based on the user's query and uses an LLM to generate an answer based *only* on the retrieved context from the troubleshooting guide. **It does not analyze the specific trigger settings or logs.**\n",
        "  - **Characteristics**: Generally **fast** and **low cost** due to minimal LLM interaction. Provides **generic answers** without analyzing specific system states.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Agentic RAG**:\n",
        "  - **Process**: A multi-step reasoning process that involves multiple LLM calls. It retrieves relevant information from the troubleshooting guides, creates a troubleshooting plan dynamically, *and* analyzes provided state data (like trigger settings and logs) to form a diagnosis. When a user submits a query, relevant chunks are retrieved from the vector database. This is then sent to the LLM with a request to create a dynamic plan based on the troubleshooting guide. The agent then executes each troubleshooting step with the help of the LLM, analyzing the provided trigger settings and logs for each step, and provides the result and suggestion from each execution before synthesizing a final answer.\n",
        "  - **Characteristics**: **Thorough** and provides a **specific solution** by analyzing the actual system state. However, it is **slower** and **more costly** due to the increased number of steps and LLM interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Adaptive RAG**:\n",
        "  - **Process**: Introduces an intelligent router that assesses the **complexity** of the incoming user query. Simple queries are directed to the faster Traditional RAG path, while complex queries requiring deeper analysis are sent to the more thorough Agentic RAG path.\n",
        "  - **Characteristics**: Aims to achieve the **best balance** between speed and quality by using the most appropriate method for each query type.\n",

        "The notebook demonstrates these approaches by:\n",
        "1. Setting up a knowledge base in ChromaDB and simulating trigger state data.\n",
        "2. Implementing and running both Traditional and Agentic RAG methods on a troubleshooting query.\n",
        "3. Comparing their performance metrics (Latency, LLM Calls) and output quality, **including evaluation of output quality using an LLM as a judge.**\n",

        "- Traditional RAG is effective for quick information retrieval (simple queries).\n",
