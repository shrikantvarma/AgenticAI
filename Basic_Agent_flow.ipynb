        "\n",
        "1.  The agent receives a user query.\n",
        "2.  Based on the query and a system prompt guiding the ReAct pattern, the language model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`) generates a **Thought** process and potentially an **Action**.\n",
        "3.  If the model suggests an **Action** (a tool call), the Python code in the notebook intercepts this request.\n",
        "4.  The code executes the corresponding external **Tool** function with the arguments provided by the model.\n",
        "5.  The result from the tool execution (the **Observation**) is fed back into the conversation history.\n",
        "6.  The updated conversation history is sent back to the language model, allowing it to consider the **Observation** and continue the loop with a new **Thought**, another **Action**, or a **Final Answer**.\n",
        "7.  The loop continues until the model provides a **Final Answer** or a maximum number of steps is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tools Included:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `get_weather`: Fetches fake weather data for a given city (demonstration tool).\n",
        "*   `calculate_expression`: Safely evaluates a mathematical expression.\n",
