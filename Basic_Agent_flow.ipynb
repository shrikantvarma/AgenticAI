        "# ReAct Agent with Tool Use in Google Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "This repository contains a Google Colab notebook demonstrating a simple implementation of a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) agent that can use external tools via the OpenAI API.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is a ReAct Agent?\n",
        "\n",
        "ReAct is a pattern that combines **Reasoning** (generating thoughts to determine the next step) and **Acting** (interacting with external environments through tools). The agent interleaves these steps in a loop to solve tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Implements the core ReAct loop (Thought, Action, Observation).\n",
        "*   Uses the OpenAI API for the language model's reasoning.\n",
        "*   Includes examples of tool definitions for:\n",
        "    *   Fetching fake weather data.\n",
        "    *   Evaluating mathematical expressions.\n",
        "    *   Searching for recent news on the web using DuckDuckGo.\n",
        "*   Designed to run in a Google Colab environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Open the Notebook:** Open the provided Google Colab notebook in your browser.\n",
        "2.  **Get an OpenAI API Key:** Obtain an API key from the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/).\n",
        "3.  **Add API Key to Colab Secrets:** In the left-hand sidebar of Google Colab, click the \"🔑 Secrets\" tab. Add a new secret with the key name `OPENAI_API_KEY` and paste your OpenAI API key as the value.\n",
        "4.  **Install Dependencies:** Run the cell containing the `!pip install` command to install the necessary Python libraries (`openai` and `duckduckgo-search`).\n",
        "5.  **Run Cells:** Execute the notebook cells sequentially to define the tools, system prompt, and the `react_agent` function.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How it Works\n",
        "\n",
        "The `react_agent` function is the core of the implementation. It:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Initializes the conversation with a system prompt explaining the ReAct pattern.\n",
        "2.  Enters a loop for a predefined number of steps.\n",
        "3.  Sends the current conversation history to the OpenAI model.\n",
        "4.  Parses the model's response for a \"Thought:\", \"Action:\", or \"Final Answer:\".\n",
        "5.  If an \"Action:\" is detected, it identifies the tool name and arguments.\n",
        "6.  It then calls the corresponding Python function defined as a tool.\n",
        "7.  The result of the tool call (\"Observation\") is added back to the conversation history.\n",
        "8.  If a \"Final Answer:\" is detected, the process concludes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The implementation includes logic to parse tool calls from the model's text output, mimicking the original ReAct paper's style, as well as handling structured tool calls if the model provides them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "The following tools are defined and available for the agent to use:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`get_weather(city: str)`**: Returns fake weather data for a few predefined cities.\n",
        "*   **`calculate_expression(expression: str)`**: Safely evaluates a given mathematical expression.\n",
        "*   **`search_web_news(query: str, max_results: int = 3)`**: Searches for recent news articles based on a query using the DuckDuckGo search engine and returns the top results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each tool has a corresponding schema defined in the `tools` list, which is provided to the OpenAI API so the model knows about the available tools and their parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the setup is complete and all necessary cells have been run, you can use the `react_agent` function to interact with the agent:"
